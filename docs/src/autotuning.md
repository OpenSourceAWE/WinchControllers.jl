# Autotuning

## Introduction
The winch controller has 34 parameters (see [Winchcontroller Settings](@ref)). To determine and optimize all of them manually is time consuming and error prone, in particular if the physical system is changing. Therefore some form of automated tuning is desirable.

## Methodology
When the [Performance Indicators](@ref) are defined, an optimizer can be used to determine the controller parameters. The controller is using three PID controllers and a mixer. The following parameters are tuned automatically:
```julia
    wcs.i_speed  # the speed controller gain
    wcs.p_speed  # the speed controller proportional gain
    wcs.t_blend  # the blending time for switching between controllers
    wcs.pf_low   # the lower force controller gain
    wcs.if_low   # the lower force controller proportional gain
    wcs.pf_high  # the upper force controller gain
    wcs.if_high  # the upper force controller integral gain
    wcs.df_high  # the differential gain of the upper force controller
```
The global, blackbox optimizer package [NOMAD.jl](https://github.com/bbopt/NOMAD.jl) is used for the optimization process, together with a test case that mimics extreme wind conditions.
With a very simple system model it allows to find an optimal solution within less than one minute.

The results can be influence with the new parameters:
```yaml
damage_factor: 0.05 # damage at max acceleration for jerk_factor=0
jerk_factor:   0.90 # factor for the jerk (derivative of the acceleration), 0..1 
```
Increase the damage factor to make the controller less aggressive. Decrease the jerk_factor to reduce the 
maximal accelerations.

## Example
To run the auto-tuning script, launch Julia and execute:
```julia
include("scripts/autotune.jl")
```
It will use the initial conditions provided in the file "data/wc_settings.yaml" and save the result in "data/wc_settings_tuned.yaml".

All values are limited to $\hat x \le 2.5x~\land~\hat x \le x/2.5$, where $x$ is the original value and $\hat x$ the optimized value. Therefore make sure that none of the original values is zero.

Example output:
```julia

Cache hits:                   107
Total number of evaluations:  1004
